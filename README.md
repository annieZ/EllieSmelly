# Ellie Smelly!  Capture, Categorize, Recognize smells to build the World Smells Collection 

The world is full of smells, but only one Ellie to help find what they are.  The objective of this prototype is to build a gadget to capture, categorize and recognize smells with the purpose of building a collection of smells.  A collection of smells will allow to create all kinds of devices to solve World’s challenges, from health to security…. and why not, fun applications like finding Ellie’s ball.
